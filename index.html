          Hi! I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/main/"><b>InfluxData</b></a>, based in the Bay Area. 
          I recently graduated from San Jose State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
          <br><br>
          
          Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Microsoft, Tesla, SRI International, and Intuitive
          Surgical. In college, I spent a year as a Research Assistant in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/meaninglabusc/"><b>The Meaning Lab</b></a> 
          where I worked on projects related to degree semantics and cognitive categorization. Here's a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8393094_Numerical_Cognition_Without_Words_Evidence_From_Amazonia"><b>paper</b></a> I really enjoyed reading during my time there
          and continue to think about from time to time. I have experience working in different development settings in both industry and academia.
